title: A Survey of Machine Learning for Big Code and Naturalness
---
Research at the intersection of machine learning, programming language, and
software engineering has recently taken important steps in proposing learnable
probabilistic models of source code that exploit code's abundance of patterns.
This website and the accompanying article surveys this work.

Like writing and speaking, software development is a human language act.  
At its core,
the naturalness of software employs statistical modeling over big code to
reason about rich variety of programs developers write.  This new line of
research is inherently interdisciplinary, uniting the machine learning and 
natural language processing communities with software engineering
and programming language communities. We present a [taxonomy](\taxnomomy)
based on the underlying design principles of each model and use it to navigate
the literature. The full survey text can be found [here]().
